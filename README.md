ðŸ“Œ About the Game
Pig Game is a turn-based game for two players. Each player rolls a die as many times as they want during their turn, adding each roll to their current score. 
But be careful! If a player rolls a 1, they lose all the points accumulated in that round and the turn passes to the other player. Players can also choose to 
"hold", saving their current score to their total and ending their turn. The first player to reach 100 points wins!
